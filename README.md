This project titled "Linked List Implementation in C" was completed as part of the CODTECH internship to understand and demonstrate the concept of dynamic data structures using a singly linked list. The program was developed and tested using the Programiz Online C Compiler, a web-based platform that allows easy writing, compiling, and execution of C programs without any installation. In this task, a linked list was created with basic operations such as insertion of nodes at the end, deletion of a node by its value, and traversal (displaying the list). The implementation used pointers and dynamic memory allocation to manage nodes efficiently. This project helped in building a strong foundation of how memory and data structures work in C. Understanding linked lists is essential for future projects involving stacks, queues, memory management systems, and real-world applications such as navigation systems, undo features in editors, and efficient data handling in software development.
